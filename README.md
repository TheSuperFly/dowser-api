# Dowser - API

Dowser was a prototype app to find good places to be when traveling.

This was the API I made for the app, backed with Hapi.js.

Today, Dowser has been discontinued.

## Usage

1. In the `/app` folder 
```
yarn && yarn start 
# or the npm way
npm install && npm start
```

2. Visit `http://localhost:7777/random/spawnRandomPlace` to spawn random places

3. Check Homefeed here `http://localhost:7777/homefeed/get`.

## Heads-up!

This project was made mid-2016, ES6 in node.js was not so viable. That's why I still use `var`.
